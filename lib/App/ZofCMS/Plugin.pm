    PLEASE INCLUDE DECENT PLUGIN DOCUMENTATION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documeantation is intended for ZofCMS plugin authors, whether you are
coding a plugin for personal use or planning to upload to CPAN. Uploads
are more than welcome.

First of all, the plugin must be located in App::ZofCMS::Plugin:: namespace.

At the very least the plugin must contain to subs:

    sub new { bless {}, shift }

This is a constructor, you don't have to use a hashref for the object but
it's recommended. Currently no argumeants (except a class name) are passed
to C<new()> but that may be changed in the future.

Second required sub is C<sub process {}> the C<@_> will contain the
following (in this order):

    $self     -- object of your plugin
    $template -- hashref which is ZofCMS template, go nuts
    $query    -- hashref containing query parameters as keys/values
    $config   -- App::ZofCMS::Config object, from here you can obtain
                 a CGI object via C<cgi()> method.

Return value is discarded.

Normally a plugin would take user input from ZofCMS template hashref.
If you are using anything outside the C<d> key (as described in
L<App::ZofCMS::Template> please C<delete()> the key from ZofCMS template.
