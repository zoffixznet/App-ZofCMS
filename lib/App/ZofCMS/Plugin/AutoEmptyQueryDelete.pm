=head1 NAME

App::ZofCMS::Plugin::AutoEmptyQueryDelete - automatically delete empty keys from query parameters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    plugins => [
        { AutoEmptyQueryDelete => 100 },
        # plugins that work on query parameters with larger priority value
    ],

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The module is a plugin for L<App::ZofCMS> that I made after I got sick and tired of
constantly writing this (where C<$q> is query parameters hashref):

    do_something
        if defined $q->{foo}
            and length $q->{foo};

By simply including this module in the list of plugins to run, I can save a few keystrokes
by writing:

    do_something
        if exists $q->{foo};

This documeantation assumes you've read L<App::ZofCMS>, L<App::ZofCMS::Config> and L<App::ZofCMS::Template>

=head1 WHAT DOES THE PLUGIN DO

The plugin doesn't do much, but simply C<delete()>s query parameters that are not defined
or are of zero length if they are. With that being done, we can use a simple C<exists()>
on a key.

=head1 USING THE PLUGIN

Plugin does not need any configuration. It will be run as long as it is included
in the list of the plugins to run:

    plugins => [
        { AutoEmptyQueryDelete => 100 },
        # plugins that work on query parameters with larger priority value
    ],

Make sure that the priority of the plugin is set to run B<before> your other code
that would check on query with C<exists()>
