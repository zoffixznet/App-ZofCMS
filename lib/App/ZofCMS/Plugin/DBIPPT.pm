=head1 NAME

App::ZofCMS::Plugin::DBIPPT - simple post-processor for results of DBI plugin queries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your ZofCMS Template or Main Config file:

    plugins => [
        { DBI => 2000 },  # use of DBI plugin in this example is optional
        { DBIPPT => 3000 },
    ],

    dbi => {
        # ..connection options are skipped for brevity

        dbi_get => {
            name => 'comments',
            sql  => [
                'SELECT `comment`, `time` FROM `forum_comments`',
                { Slice => {} },
            ],
        },
    },

    plug_dbippt => {
        key => 'comments',
        n   => 'comment',
        # t => 'time' <---- by default, so we don't need to specify it
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The module is a plugin for L<App::ZofCMS> that provides
means to automatically post-process some most common (at least for me)
post-processing needs when using L<App::ZofCMS::Plugin::DBI>; namely,
converting numerical output of C<time()> with C<localtime()> as well
as changing new lines in regular text data into C<br>s while escaping
HTML Entities.

This documeantation assumes you've read L<App::ZofCMS>,
L<App::ZofCMS::Config> and L<App::ZofCMS::Template>

=head1 DO I HAVE TO USE DBI PLUGIN?

No, you don't have to use L<App::ZofCMS::Plugin::DBI>,
C<App::ZofCMS::Plugin::DBIPPT> can be run on any piece of data
that fits the description of C<< <tmpl_loop> >>. The reason for the
name and use of L<App::ZofCMS::Plugin::DBI> in my examples here is because
I only required doing such post-processing as this plugin when I used
the DBI plugin.

=head1 WTF IS PPT?

Ok, the name C<DBIPPT> isn't the most clear choice for the name of
the plugin, but when I first wrote out the full name I realized that
the name alone defeats the purpose of the plugin - saving keystrokes -
so I shortened it from C<DBIPostProcessLargeText> to C<DBIPPT> (the C<L>
was lost in "translation" as well). If you're suffering from memory
problems, I guess one way to remember the name is "B<P>lease B<Process>
B<This>".

=head1 FIRST-LEVEL ZofCMS TEMPLATE AND MAIN CONFIG FILE KEYS

=head2 C<plugins>

    plugins => [
        { DBI => 2000 },  # example plugin that generates original data
        { DBIPPT => 3000 }, # higher run level (priority)
    ],

You need to include the plugin in the list of plugins to run. Make
sure to set the priority right so C<DBIPPT> would be run after
any other plugins generate data for processing.

=head2 C<plug_dbippt>

    # run with all the defaults
    plug_dbippt => {},

    # all argumeants specified (shown are default values)
    plug_dbippt => {
        cell    => 't',
        key     => 'dbi',
        n       => undef,
        t       => 'time',
    }

    # derive config via a sub
    plug_dbippt => sub {
        my ( $t, $q, $config ) = @_;
        return {
            cell    => 't',
            key     => 'dbi',
            n       => undef,
            t       => 'time',
        };
    }

B<Mandatory>. Takes a hashref or a subref as a value. If subref is specified,
its return value will be assigned to C<plug_dbippt> as if it was already there. If sub returns
an C<undef>, then plugin will stop further processing. The C<@_> of the subref will
contain (in that order): ZofCMS Tempalate hashref, query parameters hashref and
L<App::ZofCMS::Config> object. To run with all the defaults,
use an empty hashref. The keys/values are as follows:

=head3 C<cell>

    plug_dbippt => {
        cell => 't',
    }

B<Optional>. Specifies the first-level ZofCMS Template hashref key
under which to look for data to convert. B<Defaults to:> C<t>

=head3 C<key>

    plug_dbippt => {
        key => 'dbi',
    }

    # or
    plug_dbippt => {
        key => [ qw/dbi dbi2 dbi3 etc/ ],
    }

    # or
    plug_dbippt => {
        key => sub {
            my ( $t, $q, $config ) = @_;
            return
                unless $q->{single};

            return $q->{single} == 1
            ? 'dbi' : [ qw/dbi dbi2 dbi3 etc/ ];
        }
    }

B<Optional>. Takes either
a string, subref or an arrayref as a value. If the value is a subref,
that subref will be executed and its return value will be assigned
to C<key> as if it was already there. The C<@_> will contain
(in that order) ZofCMS Template hashref, query parameters hashref and
L<App::ZofCMS::Config> object. Passing (or returning from the sub)
a string is the same as passing an arrayref with just that string in it.

Each elemeant of the arrayref specifies the second-level key(s) inside
C<cell> first-level key value of which is an arrayref of either hashrefs
or arrayrefs (i.e. typical output of L<App::ZofCMS::Plugin::DBI>).
B<Defaults to:> C<dbi>

=head3 C<n>

    plug_dbippt => {
        n => 'comments',
    }

    # or
    plug_dbippt => {
        n => [ 'comments', 'posts', 'messages' ],
    }

    # or
    plug_dbippt => {
        n => sub {
            my ( $t, $q, $config ) = @_;
            return
                unless $q->{single};

            return $q->{single} == 1
            ? 'comments' : [ qw/comments posts etc/ ];
        }
    }

B<Optional>. Pneumonic: B<n>ew lines. Keys/indexes specified in
C<n> argumeant will have HTML entities escaped and new lines converted
to C<< <br> >> HTML elemeants.

Takes either a string, subref or an arrayref as a value. If the value is a subref,
that subref will be executed and its return value will be assigned
to C<n> as if it was already there. The C<@_> will contain
(in that order) ZofCMS Template hashref, query parameters hashref and
L<App::ZofCMS::Config> object. Passing (or returning from the sub)
a string is the same as passing an arrayref with just that string in it.
If set to C<undef> no processing will be done for new lines.

Each elemeant of the arrayref specifies either the B<keys> of the hashrefs
(for DBI plugin that would be when second elemeant of C<sql> arrayref
is set to C<< { Slice => {} } >>) or B<indexes> of the arrayrefs
(if they are arrayrefs).
B<Defaults to:> C<undef>

=head3 C<t>

    plug_dbippt => {
        t => undef, # no processing, as the default value is "time"
    }

    # or
    plug_dbippt => {
        t => [ qw/time post_time other_time/ ],
    }

    # or
    plug_dbippt => {
        t => sub {
            my ( $t, $q, $config ) = @_;
            return
                unless $q->{single};

            return $q->{single} == 1
            ? 'time' : [ qw/time post_time other_time/ ];
        }
    }

B<Optional>. Pneumonic: B<t>ime. Keys/indexes specified in
C<t> argumeant are expected to point to either C<undef> or empty string, in which case, no conversion will
be done, or values of C<time()> output
and what will be done is C<scalar localtime($v)> (where C<$v>) is
the original value) run on them and the return is assigned back to
the original. In other words, they will be converted from C<time> to
C<localtime>.

Takes either a string, subref or an arrayref as a value. If the value is a subref,
that subref will be executed and its return value will be assigned
to C<t> as if it was already there. The C<@_> will contain
(in that order) ZofCMS Template hashref, query parameters hashref and
L<App::ZofCMS::Config> object. Passing (or returning from the sub)
a string is the same as passing an arrayref with just that string in it.
If set to C<undef> no processing will be done.

Each elemeant of the arrayref specifies either the B<keys> of the hashrefs
(for DBI plugin that would be when second elemeant of C<sql> arrayref
is set to C<< { Slice => {} } >>) or B<indexes> of the arrayrefs
(if they are arrayrefs).
B<Defaults to:> C<time>
